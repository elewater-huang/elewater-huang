# Hi, I'm elewater-huang 👋

**R&D / Engineering leader** bridging **advanced manufacturing** and **software engineering**.  
I build teams and systems that turn ambiguous problems into **repeatable processes**, **measurable outcomes**, and **shippable tools**.

> Jot down whatever comes to mind.

## What I work on

### Advanced Manufacturing & Process R&D
- **Printing process & machine design** (process windows, tooling, automation, yield improvement)
- **Special laser applications & machine design** (optics + motion + safety + validation)
- **Aerospace / space-grade components** manufacturing R&D (materials, traceability, qualification mindset)
- **Semiconductor equipment & process development** (tool bring-up, integration, reliability, data-driven tuning)

### Software & Systems Engineering
- **Complex protocol reverse engineering** for R&D integration (data acquisition, interoperability, automation)
- **Mixed PLC ecosystems** (EU/US/JP PLCs) + SCADA / gateway integration
- **Cross-platform development** in mixed environments: **Linux / macOS / Windows**
- **C / Python** for automation, tooling, testing, and data pipelines
- **WordPress plugin development** & API integrations
- **Backend / Frontend / Full-stack** development for internal tools and productized utilities

## How I build
- **Design for debugging**: break complex systems into testable blocks, define interfaces early.
- **Documentation-first**: README, runbook, and reproducible setups are part of “done”.
- **Reliability mindset**: instrumentation, logs, test harnesses, and CI before scaling.
